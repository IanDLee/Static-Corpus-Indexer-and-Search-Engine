# Static Corpus Indexer and Search Engine

## Overview:

This project is a simple yet powerful text search engine that leverages an inverted index for efficient search query processing.
It is designed to allow users to search for words or phrases in a collection of documents, returning relevant results quickly.

## Features

- **Efficient Text Searching**: Uses an inverted index to enable fast searching through large volumes of text.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for entering search queries and viewing results.
- **Customizable Stopword List**: Allows for customization of stopwords to better fit the needs of the specific text corpus being indexed.

## How We Built It

- **Inverted Index**: The core of our search engine is the inverted index, generated by parsing documents, filtering out common stopwords (using our curated stopwords.txt), and indexing the remaining terms. This process is handled by CreateInvertedIndex.py.
- **Search Engine Logic**: The SearchEngine.py script processes user queries against the inverted index, fetching and displaying matching documents quickly. This script represents the bridge between the user's input via the GUI and the indexed data stored by the system.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: To make our search engine accessible to all users, we developed a simple yet effective GUI (GUI.py). This interface allows users to enter search queries and displays results in a user-friendly manner.
- **Efficient Filtering and Ranking**: Our search algorithm not only identifies relevant documents but also ranks them based on relevance to the query. This ranking is determined by the frequency and distribution of query terms within the documents.

## How To Use

- **1. Prepare your text documents**: Prepare your text documents in a directory. The documents can be in any text format.
- **2. Run CreateInvertedIndex.py**: Run CreateInvertedIndex.py to index your documents. This will generate an inverted index based on the contents of the documents and the stopwords defined in stopwords.txt.
- **3. Launch the application**: Launch the application by running GUI.py. This will open the graphical interface.
- **4. Search**: Enter your search query into the GUI and hit search to view the results.
  
## What's Next

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Enhancements**: Incorporating NLP techniques to improve the understanding of user queries and return more relevant results, even when queries are phrased in conversational language.
